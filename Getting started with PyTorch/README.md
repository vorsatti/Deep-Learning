## Getting started with Pytorch

For a deep understanding of how neural networks work I think is better to build them from scratch using PyTorch.

## IPython Notebooks:

- [Pytorch 101](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vorsatti/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Getting%20started%20with%20PyTorch/Pytorch%20101.ipynb)

- [Training a neural networks with PyTorch 101 - MINST](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vorsatti/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Getting%20started%20with%20PyTorch/Training%20a%20neural%20networks%20with%20PyTorch%20101%20-%20MINST.ipynb)
